This repository contains files that I used to generate Sliding Mode Control for a quadcopter vehicle.
Shall you have any questions, please send me an email: Amr.Hennawy@aucegypt.edu
I will publish the document used for generating these files once it is finished
Open the Simulink file which will automatically call all other functions and files, make sure all files are located in the same folder
